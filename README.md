## Frontend Multi-page website

For your frontend project, build a simple functional website page, this website should include the following pages, and must route properly

```

A responsive landing page

A registration page with form

A login page with forms

A working mobile menu (or sidebar)

```

### Optional goals

Make the login and signup page look functional, simulating a login process (let your imagination run wild, be as creative as you can possibly can).
